 «In 2011, only five countries — Kuwait,Lebanon, Myanmar, Nauru and United Arab Emirates — did not allow naturalization under any conditions. By contrast 65 per cent of Governments had “non-restricted” naturalization policies, and another 32 per cent allowed naturalization under “restricted” conditions».
