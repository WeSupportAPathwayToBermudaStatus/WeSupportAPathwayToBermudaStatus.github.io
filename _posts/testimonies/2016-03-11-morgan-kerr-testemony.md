<blockquote class="blockquote-style lead">
At a very young age I moved to Bermuda... no fault of my own. I was 2 years old. My father arrived in Bermuda in 2000. My mother followed a year later with me. I have been raised and spent my entire life here but both my parents are Scottish. My father has been here for 16 years, going 17 in September, my mother 15 years. Both of my parents would now qualify for PRC under the Pathway To Status, something I have been hoping for, for a very long time. <br>  
 
Growing up my parents have always been on a work permit and every year they were uncertain if we had to pack up our life here and move back to Scotland, a place I'm not familiar with.<br>
 
I have attended nursery, preschool, primary, middle, and high school. Currently I attend the Berkeley Institute and in 3 months I will be a graduate. Bermuda is my home, the only home I honestly know. This is home regardless if I was born here or not. In December, I turn 18. I must leave the island or attend Bermuda College where I could stay until I was 21 on my parents work permit but I would not be able to work to fund my college fees. <br>
 
This is a very frustrating time for me because I don't want to be separated from my family, my whole life is here, my friends my loved ones everything. If I leave I feel like both my parents and I will be deprived of family life. Like a lot of others I am very affected by it. People have always been shocked when I tell them I'm not from Bermuda.<br>
 
I have one sister who was raised and born here. She is not entitled to any Bermudian Status. In my eyes I am Bermudian. Why? People will question this but my reason is because I've spent my whole entire life here and know nothing but the Bermudian lifestyle and culture. I have been very blessed to be raised on this island and met so many wonderful people.<br>
 
This is where I want to be, my island home. Nothing compares to here.
