To My Fellow Bermudians,</br>

I have ABSOLUTELY no problem with Bermudians being upset over this whole immigration thing. I have NO problem with Bermudians standing up for what they believe is right. I am with you when i say that I don't agree how this is being handled. I can not speak for everyone when I say this but I believe that the Government should deal with each case individually when it comes to obtaining status. </br>

I have heard a lot of stories, some I empathize with and others I don't. We are all entitled to our own opinion. I have read some nasty comments, some of which I cannot ignore, but I have came to the conclusion that not everybody is going to agree with you.</br>

Just like the people of Bermuda standing up for what they believe is right, I will continue to do the same thing. I am 27 years old. I was born and raised on this beautiful island I call home. The first attempt to obtain status on my 18th birthday was denied because I was born after July 31, 1989.</br>

Never did I imagine it would be denied as my siblings were successful with their application. However I was able to receive my PRC (B) through my dad which I am thankful for but i don't feel it is enough. My fight continues.</br>

I applied through connections with Bermudians because as I previously stated my sister (born in 1978), brother (born in 1980) and daughter are all Bermudian. Again, I was denied. A few years later my parents become eligible to get status and again I fall into a loophole because they are unable to give me status because I am over the age of twenty-two.</br>

This has been a constant battle. Such an emotional roller coaster. So now my situation becomes more than just a political issue. This is now a human rights issue. It should not be allowed to fragment families. I have been schooled here all of my life, made some awesome friends; some during my school years and some during my employment.</br>

While there are people saying I have another place to call home and go back to, that is NOT the case. I would pick Bermuda over Portugal any day. I cannot even begin to fathom leaving this island, leaving my friends, leaving the beaches, the great food, the great lovable people and so many other things.</br>

I love the island, the people, the traditions, the holidays, the food. This is home to me. This is where i want to be and where I want to raise my Bermudian child to be the best she can be and show her all the great things this island is made of.</br>

In my heart i am truly a Bermudian, accent and all.</br>
