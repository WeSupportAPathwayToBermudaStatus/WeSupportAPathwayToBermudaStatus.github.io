Good day, </br>

I am writing on behalf of the youth looped up into 'No Pathways To Status'. I am eager to share my story to some who don't understand how serious things can be.</br>

My parents came here some 24 years ago, my father has obtained a PRC (b). Therefore, I am not capable of getting it passed onto me. There are many young people in my predicament who fear what will happen with them next.</br>

I was born in Bermuda in 1997 to Portuguese parents who have been in Bermuda well over 20 years. I've never left the island other than for vaction for no long period of time. I've attended nursery through high school on the island where I am now attending the Bermuda College, and I can't even apply for a PRC.</br>

Bermuda is literaly all I that know and I don't just say that to say it. Bermuda is all I know.</br>

At the age of 19, I can only reside in "my home" as long as I'm in school. I've been separated from my siblings who were in the same situation and onced they reached a certain age, they had to leave Bermuda. I am allowed back into Bermuda on a re-entry letter, which is renewed monthly as a dependent of a PRC holder.</br>

Once I've finsihed College I must leave. There is no other choice in place for me here, the place I was born in, and have contributed so much towards. Where will I go? Home? This is my home.</br>

Recently, I've been getting comments from my peers such as, "What, you aren't Bermudian?" or "Since when? You're just as Bermudian as me!"</br>

If Pathways To Status doesn't follow through, I am forced to leave my home, my comfort. Not because I'd like to, but because I would be forced to. My dreams since young have always been to go away to college and take up hairdressing/cosmotology and return to my "home" and open up a salon. </br>  

We as a group of young individuals are extremely concerned. As children of PRC holders we each have different circumstances which are detrimental to us and leave us with challenges that none of us asked for. We have been handed the bad end of the stick. I have high hopes for Bermuda and its people and I hope we can all come together and take a minute to see what is right. Thank you for listening my fellow Bermudians.
