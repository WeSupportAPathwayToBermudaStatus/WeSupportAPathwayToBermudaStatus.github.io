To Whom It May Concern,
I have ABSOLUTELY no problem with Bermudians being upset over this whole immigration thing. Like I do agree if someone already has a PRC whats the sense of going for status? you have the right to work and live here be grateful not greedy. But then it comes to were children like me(and and many other) have absolutely no ties to this little island were we call home. Now that's where my concern is. I have both parents 1 working and one unable to due to back issues. If you know me , I'm all about family, how can it be fair that I'm 20 years of age and my Sister and Parents have to struggle to put me threw College ( @ Bermuda College) because I have to EVERY year come December ask immigration if I'm eligible to stay on the island and continue with my degree. What if they tell me no? Where do I go? I don't speak with family in Azores, and Lord knows I'm not fluent in Portuguese. You try being 20 years old asking your parents for $5 for gas money because you can't work with the fear of immigration finding some stupid reason to send you back to a place you don't call home. I do believe that the law should be changed to were children born here under a PRC holder or even just born here and has spent 20 YEARS of their life should be granted SOME time of right to work and live here. 
Anyway that's enough venting for now. Continue on with your strikes and and the fuss and cruel looks you wish to give me. At the end of the day I'm just as Bermudian as you are.
Sincerely,
A Concerned Portuguese Child.
