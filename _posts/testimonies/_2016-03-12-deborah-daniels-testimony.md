<blockquote class="blockquote-style lead">
Bermuda is in for a real eye opener and some really tough times if this doesn't go through. I am a Bermudian currently living in the UK who comes home regularly. Word is travelling far and wide and it's not a good word. Tourists can go to just as beautiful islands for far cheaper and be appreciated and not made to feel uncomfortable. There are other tax havens in just as beautiful places without the uncertainty. Is it really that unfair to give a handful of people these rights? It seems to be common decency and the humane thing to do to me! I speak from experience as my mother had to leave the island when she was divorced from my Bermudian father despite being married for more than 20 years. She had her own business employing Bermudians, volunteered for The Committee of 25 for Handicapped children, was a girls guide leader, commissioner of the girls nautical training corp plus numerous other charities and organisations. She had to leave me in Bermuda. It was devastating. The awful thing was she was Bermudian whilst married to my father but then lost everything. It is NOT humane!
