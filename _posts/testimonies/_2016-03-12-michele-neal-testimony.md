I have been reading comments made about giving Bermuda Status to long term residents and for the first time in my life I am feeling unwanted in my country of birth.<br>
I have heard non-Bermudians say they have been treated badly, disrespected, and unwanted by Bermudians. I have always thought their comments were exaggerated because I have never been treated this way. I was born in Bermuda, went to school in Bermuda and have lived and worked in Bermuda my whole life. Most of the people who know me or meet me think that I am a "born" Bermudian.<br>
Through no fault of my own I was born in Bermuda to an American mother and Irish father. My mother came to Bermuda at the age of 12 when her father transferred to the US Base. My mother grew up here and worked on the base. My father was a police officer on the Bermuda Police force for 28 years.
We did not have a lot of money. I grew up in Prospect and on Frog Lane. I had a happy, simple childhood.<br>
Made it through school and graduated in 1983.<br>
My father qualified for Bermuda status due to his time here and on the force. I could continue to live and work in Bermuda until I was 21 although I didn't know this at the time. Bermuda was my home and I never thought much about it.<br>
I may get the details and timing wrong here as I am going from memory which is not always the greatest these days! I remember being told that there was an Amnesty status that I qualified for - just in time. I also remember having to go on a work permit but I believe it was less than a year.<br>
I had never been so scared and stressed. What was going to happen to me? Were they going to kick me off the island? I had nowhere to go. I remember the day my father called me and told me my status had been approved. I was so overwhelmed. I cried.<br>
Then a few years later my father retired from the force. My parents sat me down and told me that he was retiring and they were going to move to the US. He had a couple of job offers in Bermuda but even if he took one they could not afford to live here. They wanted to own their own home and that couldn't happen here.<br>
That was in 1989. I was working as a secretary and shared an apartment with 2 others. I wasn't leaving Bermuda. Bermuda is my home, the only home I have ever known.<br>
Fast forward many, many years later. I was a divorcee. I had worked hard and saved enough money to put down on a condo. I had my own home (with a mortgage). But, something was missing in my life. Yes, I still hoped for love again but mostly I wanted a child. Hard to do by yourself so I looked into all of my options. There weren't many options left. I chose to adopt.<br>
I found my heart in Guatemala. I named him Hayden. Adoptions in Guatemala were private and cost a lot of money. I sold my condo, paid off my mortgage and started the year long process. In November 2006 Hayden came home to Bermuda at 11 months old.<br>
I was told he would be "deemed to have Bermuda Status" until he turned 18 and had to apply for it between 18 and 21. Not a problem until life took a turn for the worse.<br>
Fast forward to 2012. Diagnosed with cancer. Underwent surgery and treatment. Good to go. 2013 - diagnosed with cancer. Underwent surgery and treatment. From 2012 to 2014 I was unemployed for the first time. We lost a lot but still had each other. My biggest concern has and always will be my son. He is 10 years old. If something happens to me before he turns 18 who will make sure he sorts his status out? What if they change the Immigration act again?<br>
Bermuda is his home as well. He has nowhere else to go.<br>
Pathways to Status would give him status now.<br>
