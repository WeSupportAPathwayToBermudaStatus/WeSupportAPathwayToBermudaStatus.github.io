	<p class="lead">This group is dedicated to showing the human side of why a pathway to Bermuda Status/ PRC needs to be implemented. Many people who have ties to Bermuda do not have any possibility of becoming a citizen of the country that they consider home. We all know someone in this situation and now we have an opportunity to change it.</p>

				<p>The Government of Bermuda announced on 5 February that it was intending to amend our Immigration Legislation to provide for new pathways to permanent residency and Bermuda status in Bermuda for long-term residents.</p>
				<p>There are many reasons why the Government is choosing to do this. It will benefit Bermuda economically. Bermuda will be able to abide by international human rights standards. But most importantly, it's just the right thing to do for people who have committed their lives to Bermuda.</p>
				<p>Let's show Minister Michael Fahy and the rest of his team that we support "Pathways"!

				<p>Please send your emails. The below was posted March, 14<sup>th</sup> evening:</p>
				<p>Hi Everyone. In light of this week's events, I would like to ask ALL members who support "Pathways to Status" to immediately email the Speaker of the House of Assembly, the Honorable Randy Horton. You can either use the below message or you can create your own. We need him to hear our voices if we want this to be debated. Please do not be afraid. His email address is <a href="mailto:rhorton@parliament.bm">rhorton@parliament.bm</a></p>
				<p><blockquote class="blockquote-style">Mr Speaker - we are urging you to ensure that the House of Assembly is able to debate Government's "Pathways to Status" legislation. It is not fair that a vocal group is able to undermine the institutions of Bermudian democracy and to prevent a vote. We have proved that the “silent majority” is significantly in favor of this legislation with the petition in favor of pathways acquiring more than double the supporters of the petition supporting bipartisan immigration reform. The candlelight vigil held on Sunday was exhibited to be successful with more than 2,000 supporters attending the event. Debate in the House is the proper avenue for the scrutiny and amendment of legislation. As supporters of the legislation, we are asking you and your Honourable Colleagues to hold a debate and a yes-or-no vote.<br>
				"Let's debate the bill now!!!"</blockquote></p>
