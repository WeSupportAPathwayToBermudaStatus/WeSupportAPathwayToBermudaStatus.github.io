				<div class="lead"><blockquote>
I have been encouraged and inspired to share my story to those who are willing to read. My father was the first to arrive to Bermuda on January of 1998 with my mother and I (4 years old at the time) arriving 3 months later in March. I grew up here, went to school here, made friends, and even have other family members that reside here. Growing up I always felt like this was my home even though at times I was made to feel like I didn't belong. Even being a honour student throughout the entirety of my high school career and being offered more than one scholarship, I was forced to decline because I was not Bermudian.
In my first year of high school, I was told by my parents that there was a chance that we had to pack our belongings and go back "home". What home? This was my home. That was a stressful and emotional time for not only my family but to all our friends as well.
It was then that we found that my mother was eligible for a PRC from her sister. My father then got his PRC from his brother a year later. This was great news as I thought I would be getting the same thing once I reached the age of 18. I was very wrong. Their PRCs fell under Section 31B which meant they were not able to pass it on to myself or to my Bermuda born younger brother. So where did that leave me or worse where did that leave my brother once he reached my age.
I have a Re-Entry Permit which I have to renew every six months with provided proof from Bermuda College that I am indeed a full-time student. This entitles me to live here and to travel in and out of the country. This is the only reason I am able to reside here by the way. For if it was not for this, I would have been asked to leave. What would happen once I graduate? Would I have to leave then? These are questions I ask myself constantly. I worry about my future but most of all I worry about my brother's future as I do not want him to go through the same situation.
I understand the concerns that many have about this topic but these are people that have lived alongside you for many years. Many whom have had the same job like my father. They may very well be your next door neighbour, your doctor, your colleagues, that random stranger that greets you a "Good morning" or a "Good afternoon", after all that is the proper Bermudian manners. Please try to understand from a different point of view. Imagine what it would be like to be in one our shoes. I am sure then you would truly understand what it is like.
I would go more into details but I feel like I have shared enough. There are many who are in the same situation as I and there are others that share different stories. However, one thing does not change and that is the fact that this is our home just as much as it is your home!
Thank you for reading!
