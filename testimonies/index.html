At a very young age I moved to Bermuda... no fault of my own. I was 2 years old. My father arrived in Bermuda in 2000. My mother followed a year later with me. I have been raised and spent my entire life here but both my parents are Scottish. My father has been here for 16 years, going 17 in September, my mother 15 years. Both of my parents would now qualify for PRC under the Pathway To Status, something I have been hoping for, for a very long time. <br />  
 
Growing up my parents have always been on a work permit and every year they were uncertain if we had to pack up our life here and move back to Scotland, a place I'm not familiar with.<br />
 
I have attended nursery, preschool, primary, middle, and high school. Currently I attend the Berkeley Institute and in 3 months I will be a graduate. Bermuda is my home, the only home I honestly know. This is home regardless if I was born here or not. In December, I turn 18. I must leave the island or attend Bermuda College where I could stay until I was 21 on my parents work permit but I would not be able to work to fund my college fees. <br />
 
This is a very frustrating time for me because I don't want to be separated from my family, my whole life is here, my friends my loved ones everything. If I leave I feel like both my parents and I will be deprived of family life. Like a lot of others I am very affected by it. People have always been shocked when I tell them I'm not from Bermuda.<br />
 
I have one sister who was raised and born here. She is not entitled to any Bermudian Status. In my eyes I am Bermudian. Why? People will question this but my reason is because I've spent my whole entire life here and know nothing but the Bermudian lifestyle and culture. I have been very blessed to be raised on this island and met so many wonderful people.<br />
 
This is where I want to be, my island home. Nothing compares to here.

Dear friends and fellow members of the Bermuda community,<br />

I have never been the type of person to express political thoughts through Facebook or any other forms of social media but with what has been occurring in this community as of late, I can no longer hold back the views and emotions that I have had for many years now.<br />

Did you know that I am only able to reside in Bermuda due to the fact that I attend Bermuda College? Every six months, I must apply in order be a resident and to be able to travel freely in and out of Bermuda. Without proof of me studying at Bermuda College, I wouldnâ€™t be able to do these things and would be kicked out of the country. I graduate in two months...<br />

My mother and father have been in Bermuda for 25 and 26 years respectfully. I was born in Bermuda, raised in Bermuda, and attended St. Johns Pre-School, Northlands Primary, Dellwood Middle and CedarBridge Academy. The opportunity to apply for a Permanent Resident Certificate (PRC) was presented to my father, but through a different and quite unfortunate circumstance.<br />

As some may or may not know, this law was enacted in 2002 but in order to become a Permanent Resident of Bermuda, a cutoff date was established and had to be met. The cutoff date that was created was of July 31, 1989, and in order to become a PRC holder, one had to arrive in Bermuda before that date.<br />

My father arrived here in December of 1989 and missed it by four months. As this was his case, his only option was to apply for PRC under Section 31B and was only able to remain in Bermuda and attain it on the behalf of his brother who attained PRC under Section 31A, as he has been here since 1981. When in this predicament under Section 31B, one is no longer able to pass this PRC down to their spouse or children and that is exactly where my difficult predicament comes into play.<br />

Although I was born here, raised here and lived in Bermuda for my entire life, there is still that setback where I was born to Non-Bermudian parents. Although this may be the case and is thoroughly understood, it remains unjust for me to not be able to apply for PRC, Bermudian Status or at least be deemed as a Bermudian.<br />

When confronted with different situations in high school, such as the time to apply for scholarships and universities, my only option was to abstain. After being an honor student throughout all four years of high school, after being accepted into Brock University, and after graduating as Vice President of the National Honors Society where I took part in many different actions and volunteer work within the community, my only option was to attend Bermuda College due to financial reasons and also in order to remain in Bermuda.<br />

As stated, this in fact is the only way that I am able to reside in Bermuda. If not at Bermuda College and without proof that I am a full-time student there, I have no right to reside in Bermuda. But the question is, where will I go? I am scheduled to graduate in two months time and the question still remains, where will I go?<br />

Bermuda is my home and Bermuda has always been my home. I want it to remain this way for the rest of my life. If given the chance to do this and if given the chance to finally be accepted by the community as a fellow Bermudian, which I am sure that I deserve just as much as every other Bermudian, I know with all of my heart that it will be more than worth it.<br />

This will not only benefit me and my future family, but would also benefit the island of Bermuda. If the Bermuda Immigration and Protection Amendment 2016 is passed, I am sure that this opportunity would enable me and many others who are in similar predicaments to contribute towards this society with regards to many economical and social aspects.<br />

These individuals have been here for 15 years, 20 years and more. These are individuals that have contributed to this society in many different ways. These are individuals that have dedicated more than half and if not their entire lives to this community. What makes them different? What makes them not as important or accepted when all that is trying to be accomplished is a being able to live a happy lifestyle?<br />

I strongly believe that a comprehensive change should be made simply because of the fact that this isnâ€™t thousands and thousands of individuals that are being talked about. As established, it is a very small minority within the public that would be able to apply.<br />

Jobs will not be taken away from Bermudians as these individuals already have jobs. If anything, job opportunities would be created with this amendment as they would now have the chance of owning property and owning their own business. These individuals have been here for 20 or more years. These are not newly introduced people that are coming into Bermuda.<br />

This is only a part of my story and struggle that I have experienced over the years. These are merely my views and opinions on this particular matter as all I am trying to do is bring not only peace and happiness to this society, but also understanding as I believe that looking at an issue from a different perspective or getting to know what it may be like in the shoes of another can make a difference.<br />

If you have any concerns or questions, please do not hesitate to make them with a respectful approach as I am more than happy to respond.

Good day, 

I am writing on behalf of the youth looped up into 'No Pathways To Status'. I am eager to share my story to some who don't understand how serious things can be.

My parents came here some 24 years ago, my father has obtained a PRC (b). Therefore, I am not capable of getting it passed onto me. There are many young people in my predicament who fear what will happen with them next.

I was born in Bermuda in 1997 to Portuguese parents who have been in Bermuda well over 20 years. I've never left the island other than for vaction for no long period of time. I've attended nursery through high school on the island where I am now attending the Bermuda College, and I can't even apply for a PRC.

Bermuda is literaly all I that know and I don't just say that to say it. Bermuda is all I know.

At the age of 19, I can only reside in "my home" as long as I'm in school. I've been separated from my siblings who were in the same situation and onced they reached a certain age, they had to leave Bermuda. I am allowed back into Bermuda on a re-entry letter, which is renewed monthly as a dependent of a PRC holder.

Once I've finsihed College I must leave. There is no other choice in place for me here, the place I was born in, and have contributed so much towards. Where will I go? Home? This is my home.

Recently, I've been getting comments from my peers such as, "What, you aren't Bermudian?" or "Since when? You're just as Bermudian as me!"

If Pathways To Status doesn't follow through, I am forced to leave my home, my comfort. Not because I'd like to, but because I would be forced to. My dreams since young have always been to go away to college and take up hairdressing/cosmotology and return to my "home" and open up a salon.   

We as a group of young individuals are extremely concerned. As children of PRC holders we each have different circumstances which are detrimental to us and leave us with challenges that none of us asked for. We have been handed the bad end of the stick. I have high hopes for Bermuda and its people and I hope we can all come together and take a minute to see what is right. Thank you for listening my fellow Bermudians.

To My Fellow Bermudians,

I have ABSOLUTELY no problem with Bermudians being upset over this whole immigration thing. I have NO problem with Bermudians standing up for what they believe is right. I am with you when i say that I don't agree how this is being handled. I can not speak for everyone when I say this but I believe that the Government should deal with each case individually when it comes to obtaining status. 

I have heard a lot of stories, some I empathize with and others I don't. We are all entitled to our own opinion. I have read some nasty comments, some of which I cannot ignore, but I have came to the conclusion that not everybody is going to agree with you.

Just like the people of Bermuda standing up for what they believe is right, I will continue to do the same thing. I am 27 years old. I was born and raised on this beautiful island I call home. The first attempt to obtain status on my 18th birthday was denied because I was born after July 31, 1989.

Never did I imagine it would be denied as my siblings were successful with their application. However I was able to receive my PRC (B) through my dad which I am thankful for but i don't feel it is enough. My fight continues.

I applied through connections with Bermudians because as I previously stated my sister (born in 1978), brother (born in 1980) and daughter are all Bermudian. Again, I was denied. A few years later my parents become eligible to get status and again I fall into a loophole because they are unable to give me status because I am over the age of twenty-two.

This has been a constant battle. Such an emotional roller coaster. So now my situation becomes more than just a political issue. This is now a human rights issue. It should not be allowed to fragment families. I have been schooled here all of my life, made some awesome friends; some during my school years and some during my employment.

While there are people saying I have another place to call home and go back to, that is NOT the case. I would pick Bermuda over Portugal any day. I cannot even begin to fathom leaving this island, leaving my friends, leaving the beaches, the great food, the great lovable people and so many other things.

I love the island, the people, the traditions, the holidays, the food. This is home to me. This is where i want to be and where I want to raise my Bermudian child to be the best she can be and show her all the great things this island is made of.

In my heart i am truly a Bermudian, accent and all.
