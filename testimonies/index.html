I have been reading comments made about giving Bermuda Status to long term residents and for the first time in my life I am feeling unwanted in my country of birth.<br />
I have heard non-Bermudians say they have been treated badly, disrespected, and unwanted by Bermudians. I have always thought their comments were exaggerated because I have never been treated this way. I was born in Bermuda, went to school in Bermuda and have lived and worked in Bermuda my whole life. Most of the people who know me or meet me think that I am a "born" Bermudian.<br />
Through no fault of my own I was born in Bermuda to an American mother and Irish father. My mother came to Bermuda at the age of 12 when her father transferred to the US Base. My mother grew up here and worked on the base. My father was a police officer on the Bermuda Police force for 28 years.
We did not have a lot of money. I grew up in Prospect and on Frog Lane. I had a happy, simple childhood.<br />
Made it through school and graduated in 1983.<br />
My father qualified for Bermuda status due to his time here and on the force. I could continue to live and work in Bermuda until I was 21 although I didn't know this at the time. Bermuda was my home and I never thought much about it.<br />
I may get the details and timing wrong here as I am going from memory which is not always the greatest these days! I remember being told that there was an Amnesty status that I qualified for - just in time. I also remember having to go on a work permit but I believe it was less than a year.<br />
I had never been so scared and stressed. What was going to happen to me? Were they going to kick me off the island? I had nowhere to go. I remember the day my father called me and told me my status had been approved. I was so overwhelmed. I cried.<br />
Then a few years later my father retired from the force. My parents sat me down and told me that he was retiring and they were going to move to the US. He had a couple of job offers in Bermuda but even if he took one they could not afford to live here. They wanted to own their own home and that couldn't happen here.<br />
That was in 1989. I was working as a secretary and shared an apartment with 2 others. I wasn't leaving Bermuda. Bermuda is my home, the only home I have ever known.<br />
Fast forward many, many years later. I was a divorcee. I had worked hard and saved enough money to put down on a condo. I had my own home (with a mortgage). But, something was missing in my life. Yes, I still hoped for love again but mostly I wanted a child. Hard to do by yourself so I looked into all of my options. There weren't many options left. I chose to adopt.<br />
I found my heart in Guatemala. I named him Hayden. Adoptions in Guatemala were private and cost a lot of money. I sold my condo, paid off my mortgage and started the year long process. In November 2006 Hayden came home to Bermuda at 11 months old.<br />
I was told he would be "deemed to have Bermuda Status" until he turned 18 and had to apply for it between 18 and 21. Not a problem until life took a turn for the worse.<br />
Fast forward to 2012. Diagnosed with cancer. Underwent surgery and treatment. Good to go. 2013 - diagnosed with cancer. Underwent surgery and treatment. From 2012 to 2014 I was unemployed for the first time. We lost a lot but still had each other. My biggest concern has and always will be my son. He is 10 years old. If something happens to me before he turns 18 who will make sure he sorts his status out? What if they change the Immigration act again?<br />
Bermuda is his home as well. He has nowhere else to go.<br />
Pathways to Status would give him status now.<br />

Bermuda is in for a real eye opener and some really tough times if this doesn't go through. I am a Bermudian currently living in the UK who comes home regularly. Word is travelling far and wide and it's not a good word. Tourists can go to just as beautiful islands for far cheaper and be appreciated and not made to feel uncomfortable. There are other tax havens in just as beautiful places without the uncertainty. Is it really that unfair to give a handful of people these rights? It seems to be common decency and the humane thing to do to me! I speak from experience as my mother had to leave the island when she was divorced from my Bermudian father despite being married for more than 20 years. She had her own business employing Bermudians, volunteered for The Committee of 25 for Handicapped children, was a girls guide leader, commissioner of the girls nautical training corp plus numerous other charities and organisations. She had to leave me in Bermuda. It was devastating. The awful thing was she was Bermudian whilst married to my father but then lost everything. It is NOT humane!

To Whom It May Concern,
I have ABSOLUTELY no problem with Bermudians being upset over this whole immigration thing. Like I do agree if someone already has a PRC whats the sense of going for status? you have the right to work and live here be grateful not greedy. But then it comes to were children like me(and and many other) have absolutely no ties to this little island were we call home. Now that's where my concern is. I have both parents 1 working and one unable to due to back issues. If you know me , I'm all about family, how can it be fair that I'm 20 years of age and my Sister and Parents have to struggle to put me threw College ( @ Bermuda College) because I have to EVERY year come December ask immigration if I'm eligible to stay on the island and continue with my degree. What if they tell me no? Where do I go? I don't speak with family in Azores, and Lord knows I'm not fluent in Portuguese. You try being 20 years old asking your parents for $5 for gas money because you can't work with the fear of immigration finding some stupid reason to send you back to a place you don't call home. I do believe that the law should be changed to were children born here under a PRC holder or even just born here and has spent 20 YEARS of their life should be granted SOME time of right to work and live here. 
Anyway that's enough venting for now. Continue on with your strikes and and the fuss and cruel looks you wish to give me. At the end of the day I'm just as Bermudian as you are.
Sincerely,
A Concerned Portuguese Child.

I think the Pathway To Status is a great idea and I 110% support it because my family is one of those people who qualify for PRC and I think it is the right thing to do. In 2000 my father arrived in Bermuda. My mother followed a year later with me I was 2 years old. I have attended pre school, nursery, primary, middle and I'm ready to graduate from the Berkeley Institute. In December I turn 18 and I must leave the island or attend Bermuda college where I could stay until I was 21 on my parents work permit but I would not be able to work to fund my college fees. Bermuda is my home and this is all I know. This is home regardless if I was born here or not. Nothing compares to Bermuda and I love my life here. Even though both my parents are Scottish in my eyes I am Bermudian. My whole lifestyle has been adapted to the Bermudian culture. All of my friends are Bermudian. This isn't just about me, my sister was born here. She is not entitled to any Bermudian Status. We are both unable to work, apply for a scholarship, and internships because we don't have Bermudian status. To me I think both my parents who have been here for 15-16 years have contributed to the island and economy in many ways. My parents have always had the uncertainty of their work permit going through or not and have always been unsure if they needed to pack up their life here and move back to Scotland. I know there is families in much more serious situations. I think overall the Pathway To Status will benefit many people including all the families that are broken up and families like mine.

Dear friends and fellow members of the Bermuda community,
I have never been the type of person to express political thoughts through Facebook or any other forms of social media but with what has been occurring in this community as of late, I can no longer hold back the views and emotions that I have had for many years now.<br />
Did you know that I am only able to reside in Bermuda due to the fact that I attend Bermuda College? Every six months, I must apply in order be a resident and to be able to travel freely in and out of Bermuda. Without proof of me studying at Bermuda College, I wouldn’t be able to do these things and would be kicked out of the country. I graduate in two months...<br />
My mother and father have been in Bermuda for 25 and 26 years respectfully. I was born in Bermuda, raised in Bermuda, and attended St. Johns Pre-School, Northlands Primary, Dellwood Middle and CedarBridge Academy. The opportunity to apply for a Permanent Resident Certificate (PRC) was presented to my father, but through a different and quite unfortunate circumstance. As some may or may not know, this law was enacted in 2002 but in order to become a Permanent Resident of Bermuda, a cutoff date was established and had to be met. The cutoff date that was created was of July 31st of 1989 and in order to become a PRC holder, one had to arrive in Bermuda before that date. My father arrived here in December of 1989 and missed it by four months. As this was his case, his only option was to apply for PRC under Section 31B and was only able to remain in Bermuda and attain it on the behalf of his brother who attained PRC under Section 31A, as he has been here since 1981. When in this predicament under Section 31B, one is no longer able to pass this PRC down to their spouse or children and that is exactly where my difficult predicament comes into play.<br />
Although I was born here, raised here and lived in Bermuda for my entire life, there is still that setback where I was born to Non-Bermudian parents. Although this may be the case and is thoroughly understood, it remains unjust for me to not be able to apply for PRC, Bermudian Status or at least be deemed as a Bermudian. When confronted with different situations in high school, such as the time to apply for scholarships and universities, my only option was to abstain. After being an honor student throughout all four years of high school, after being accepted into Brock University, and after graduating as Vice President of the National Honors Society where I took part in many different actions and volunteer work within the community, my only option was to attend Bermuda College due to financial reasons and also in order to remain in Bermuda. As stated, this in fact is the only way that I am able to reside in Bermuda. If not at Bermuda College and without proof that I am a full-time student there, I have no right to reside in Bermuda. But the question is, where will I go? I am scheduled to graduate in two months time and the question still remains, where will I go?<br />
Bermuda is my home and Bermuda has always been my home. I want it to remain this way for the rest of my life. If given the chance to do this and if given the chance to finally be accepted by the community as a fellow Bermudian, which I am sure that I deserve just as much as every other Bermudian, I know with all of my heart that it will be more than worth it. This will not only benefit me and my future family, but would also benefit the island of Bermuda. If the Bermuda Immigration and Protection Amendment 2016 is passed, I am sure that this opportunity would enable me and many others who are in similar predicaments to contribute towards this society with regards to many economical and social aspects. These individuals have been here for fifteen years, twenty years and more. These are individuals that have contributed to this society in many different ways. These are individuals that have dedicated more than half and if not their entire lives to this community. What makes them different? What makes them not as important or accepted when all that is trying to be accomplished is a being able to live a happy lifestyle?<br />
I strongly believe that a comprehensive change should be made simply because of the fact that this isn’t thousands and thousands of individuals that are being talked about. As established, it is a very small minority within the public that would be able to apply. Jobs will not be taken away from Bermudians as these individuals already have jobs. If anything, job opportunities would be created with this amendment as they would now have the chance of owning property and owning their own business. These individuals have been here for twenty or more years. These are not newly introduced people that are coming into Bermuda.<br />
This is only a part of my story and struggle that I have experienced over the years. These are merely my views and opinions on this particular matter as all I am trying to do is bring not only peace and happiness to this society, but also understanding as I believe that looking at an issue from a different perspective or getting to know what it may be like in the shoes of another can make a difference.<br />
If you have any concerns or questions, please do not hesitate to make them with a respectful approach as I am more than happy to respond.

Alright I wasn't going to give my story cause I'm lucky enough to have my Bermudian status and cause I usually don't comment but I was inspired to. Hi I'm Katarina. I was born at KEMH and was raised and went to school just like many of my peers. Now yes I'm Bermudian but only because my mom was Bermudian because of her brother if not I would be in the same boat. Someone who was born and raised here still had to apply to have the right to be able to work and have rights and I thought it was ridiculous even back when I was applying for it when I was 18, before any of this happened. I thought that the idea of someone who was born here and raised here and not being able to call Bermuda my home because I had no citizenship here sucked! I was embarrassed to tell family that lived away that you think cause I live in Bermuda that I was Bermudian but I'm not and they would all say what the heck! But it's true I have friends who have to attend Bermuda college and take so many courses one after the other even if they don't want to because if they don't, they might have to leave the island. I find it ridiculous that Bermuda is suppose to be all about bringing families together yet here some people are wanting to separate families. I'm Bermudian,my parents are Bermudian, and so is my uncle but my grandparents aren't Bermudian and they have been here for 35+ years. So if this law doesn't pass and if they have to leave isn't that separating families. As a Bermudian who was lucky enough to get her status and who even had someone try to get her kicked of Bermuda for no reason I'm very lucky that they couldn't succeed because I was already Bermudian and I thank God I have them because yes I may read, write and speak fluent Portuguese but I don't know Azores as my home I know Bermuda as my home this is where I have family, friends and have had great opportunities such as being a part of the National High School Honor Scholar Society or working at ZBM as part of the Portuguese radio team, even being able to work as a nanny which I love.It also means I can continue my education and finish my studies to be an Architectural Designer any where in the world and know that I can come back. So please let us all work hard into getting this law passed because yes I agree that we all deserve to be Bermudian or at least be granted PRC!!!!

I have been encouraged and inspired to share my story to those who are willing to read. My father was the first to arrive to Bermuda on January of 1998 with my mother and I (4 years old at the time) arriving 3 months later in March. I grew up here, went to school here, made friends, and even have other family members that reside here. Growing up I always felt like this was my home even though at times I was made to feel like I didn't belong. Even being a honour student throughout the entirety of my high school career and being offered more than one scholarship, I was forced to decline because I was not Bermudian.
In my first year of high school, I was told by my parents that there was a chance that we had to pack our belongings and go back "home". What home? This was my home. That was a stressful and emotional time for not only my family but to all our friends as well.
It was then that we found that my mother was eligible for a PRC from her sister. My father then got his PRC from his brother a year later. This was great news as I thought I would be getting the same thing once I reached the age of 18. I was very wrong. Their PRCs fell under Section 31B which meant they were not able to pass it on to myself or to my Bermuda born younger brother. So where did that leave me or worse where did that leave my brother once he reached my age.
I have a Re-Entry Permit which I have to renew every six months with provided proof from Bermuda College that I am indeed a full-time student. This entitles me to live here and to travel in and out of the country. This is the only reason I am able to reside here by the way. For if it was not for this, I would have been asked to leave. What would happen once I graduate? Would I have to leave then? These are questions I ask myself constantly. I worry about my future but most of all I worry about my brother's future as I do not want him to go through the same situation.
I understand the concerns that many have about this topic but these are people that have lived alongside you for many years. Many whom have had the same job like my father. They may very well be your next door neighbour, your doctor, your colleagues, that random stranger that greets you a "Good morning" or a "Good afternoon", after all that is the proper Bermudian manners. Please try to understand from a different point of view. Imagine what it would be like to be in one our shoes. I am sure then you would truly understand what it is like.
I would go more into details but I feel like I have shared enough. There are many who are in the same situation as I and there are others that share different stories. However, one thing does not change and that is the fact that this is our home just as much as it is your home!
Thank you for reading!
